Release Notes for S0ix Selftest Tool

Thanks for using S0ix Selftest Tool. This tool is designed for Linux OS, it can
be used to do the initial debugging for the S2idle path CPU Pacakge C-state and
S0ix failures for IntelÂ® Client platforms, it also supports the basic runtime PC10
status check.

When linux users' system fails to enter PC10 or S0ix via S2idle, can use this
script to get the initial debugging infomation or potenial blockers before reporting
the bugs in the Bugzilla. This script will archive the debugging process logs,
which will be helpful for the future advanced debugging.

This tool's design follows the basic debugging process introduced in the
documents below:
